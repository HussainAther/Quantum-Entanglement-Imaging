# Quantum Entanglement Imaging

## Overview
This repository contains research and development on **quantum entanglement-based imaging** methods. These methods utilize quantum principles to improve medical imaging, such as **early breast cancer detection** using advanced X-ray steering and imaging algorithms.

## Project Goals
- Develop **quantum entanglement-based imaging algorithms** for precise image reconstruction.
- Build simulations to understand photon behavior in quantum imaging systems.
- Integrate **MART algorithms** with quantum principles for improved medical imaging technologies.
- Explore potential applications in **X-ray astronomy** and **microscopy**.
